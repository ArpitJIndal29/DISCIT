# DISCIT
It in online discussion forum exclusively for hte students of IIT Kanpur to help them clear their their doubts and queries in a much more easier and efficient manner.


Languages Used:
1)HTML-5
2)CSS-3
3)php
4)MySQL
5)Javascript(a bit)


SQL queries were written in phpMyAdmin.

Improvements required:
1)We can link DISCIT with Pingala so that for each semester a student would have have access to his/her particular courses. This way unlike the present situation all campus students can use it. Moreover it would be much easier for professor’s due to this automation.
2)Ability to create a new class. 
3)Ability to reset password in case some students forget his/her password(Since our web is now running on localhost, we don’t have a URL for our website and we need URL to implement this feature.)
4)Newsletter which sends email to subscribed users regarding posts which have maximum votes in a day, month as per users choice.
5)Google Translator
